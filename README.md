# HandBreak

HandBreak (https://handbrake.fr/) is an Open Source video transcoder. 

This reposirtory contains HandBreak presets that can be used to compress large video files into smaller sizes for portability. The presets use a combination of H.265 encoding, resolution tweaking and video bitrate throttling to achieve the smaller storage footprint. 

Needless to say that this is lossy compression and will result in introducing compression artifacts to a video file. It's worthwhile to play  with various options to customise a preset before commiting.
